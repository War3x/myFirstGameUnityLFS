 A small glance at game development and Unity engine.

I am currently developing an 3D arcade game in Unity. ENDED 22/04/2020 15:00 PM

So I developed this game in Unity, following a tutorial made by Brackeysm on YouTube.

I personally think that this a good beggining for being in the Game Development World, and to get in touch with programming in C#, for game functionality.

I have now a bigger perspective upon how games are developed and how Graphics, Movement, Rendering, all that stuff, works... Next projects will definetly consist in bigger game projects, and get the C# sharp coding down.

++ Unity is quite easy to use, and it has a quite simplistic GUI, and that allows you to manipulate components, scripts, perpective, objects within the game, etc, veri easily.
